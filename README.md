# Frontend

## Description

This is a template of a frontend to have a quick start.

This frontend is bind to the backend api who is written in rust <https://github.com/batleforc/rust-template>.

This frontend also help me learn how to use:

- Sentry or a way to include OpenTelemetry
- Orval or a way to auto generate the api client + model
- Include the auth way (login, logout, register, refresh, otp)
